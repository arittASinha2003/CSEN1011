/* Algorithm:
1. Start
2. Get number (n) from user
3. Find remainder when dividing n with every number from 2 to n
4. If remainder is 0, break and print False
5. If number is prime, take last digit and make it the first digit and repeat process from 2
6. Repeat process as many times as length of the number
7. If process never breaks, print True
8. Stop */
