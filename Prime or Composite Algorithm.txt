Algorithm to find whether a number is prime or composite:

1. Start
2. Accept a positive integer "n" (Number > 2)
3. Initialise counter with value 2
4. Divide the number with the counter value
5. If the reminder is 0, display that the number is composite and stop
6. Else, increment the counter and repeat from step 4 until counter value is less than "n"
7. After completion of all the steps, display that the number "n" is prime
8. Stop
